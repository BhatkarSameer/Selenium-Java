//GitHub Issues
	//Labels and Milestones
	//Add Issues tab to GitHub repo using Settings
	
	//Issues track Pull requests and consist of labels and milestones to mark important pull requests
	//Issues can be used as specific enhancements done to code and can be tracked similarly

//Closing Issues using GitBash
	//When you create an Issue, it is bydefault marked with a number which states the number of poull request assigned to that issue. i.e if issue created on 2nd Pull request to the remote_repo, issue is assigned #2
	
	//Directly closing an open issue from gitBash
	git commit -am "<Message>, #<issue_index_number>"
	
	//To sync the closing of the issue to GitHub
	git push
	
	//To assign commit in GitHub
	//Add the Issue to Commit comment using # after creating the issue

Benefits:
	1. If a project has multiple collaborators working individually on different enhancements, Issues can track them accordingly and can assign each user to a specific enhancement.
	
	2. Eases out the trail chain of pull requests done to the working_remote_repo
	
	3. Issues marked with Labels and milestones can be treated as User-stories, where labels are the type of work, and milestones are like sprints or deliverable timelines and can be tracked using dates and issues.
